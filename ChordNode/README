In order for this to work, the following commands must be ran in terminal:
- rmiregistry
- java RestKit: we run this so that the web browser is functional
- java NodeSupervisor: this class handles the nodes, what they do, and acts as an
intermediary between the REST server and the DHT server
- java ChordNode [word]: the word can be replaced with any word (i.e. key, letters, etc),
and it will automatically start a new node and create a key for it
