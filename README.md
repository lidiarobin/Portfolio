# Portfolio
Portfolio showcasing some examples of code I've made.

A lot of them are put into separate folders to show how they work. Each folder will have its own README to explain what the code was meant to do.

Completed throughout my time at Lancaster University. Please do not plagiarise if you're a student ( for your own good :) )
